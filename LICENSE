Hey, hey, it's dangerous! The difficulty of Shu Dao is difficult to go to the sky! Until two rulers of this region, pushed their way through in the misty ages! Forty-eight thousand years had passed, don't talk to Qin Sai. And the Great White Mountain, westward, still has only a bird's path, up to the summit of Emei Peak. Which was broken once by an earthquake and there were brave men lost, and then the ladder stone stack is hooked. High, as on a tall flag, six dragons drive the sun, While the river, far below, lashes its twisted course. Such height would be hard going for even a yellow crane, so pity the poor monkeys who have only paws to use. The Mountain of Green Clay is formed of many circles, each hundred steps, we have to turn nine turns among its mound. Panting, we brush Orion and pass the Well Star, then, holding our chests with our hands and sinking to the ground with a groan. We wonder if this westward trail will never have an end The formidable path ahead grows darker, darker stillbeginHeadpesohub.cyouheadEnding With nothing heard but the call of birds hemmed in by the ancient forest, male birds smoothly wheeling, following the females. Jathyapple, and there come to us the melancholy voices of the cuckoos, sorrow empty mountain. The difficulty of Shu Dao is difficult to get to the sky, Even to hear of it turns the cheek pale! Even the sky is not full, dry pines hang, head down, from the face of the cliffs. And a thousand plunging cataracts outroar one another, and send through ten thousand valleys a thunder of spinning stones. With all this danger upon danger, you've come a long way! Though Dagger-Tower Pass be firm and grim, and while one man guards it, ten thousand cannot force it. What if he be not loyal, but a wolf toward his fellows?. There are ravenous tigers to fear in the day, and venomous reptiles in the night. With their teeth and their fangs ready, killing people like hemp. Though the City of Silk be delectable, I would rather turn home quickly. The difficulty of Shu Dao is difficult to get to the sky, Look sideways to the west and ask for advice!
